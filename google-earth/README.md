# Google Earth
Google Earth is an an application which allows you to view the entire Earth.

Since Google Earth Pro is not compatible with arm architectures I have created a web application for it.

Download and unzip the zipfile inside this repository. Then, run the 'GoogleEarth' executable file within it.
